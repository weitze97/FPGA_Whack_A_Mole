# FPGA_Whack_A_Mole
This is my Final Project of Logic Design Lab (10920EECS207001, NTHU) with my teammate Ian.
Required devices: Basys 3â„¢ Artix-7 FPGA Trainer Board, keyboard with USB interface

# How to run this program
1. connect FPGA to a computer
2. connect a keyboard with FPGA
3. write bitstream "LFSR.bit" into FPGA
4. For instruction manual, read "Final_Project_Report_108021124_108030014.pdf"
5. Have fun :)
